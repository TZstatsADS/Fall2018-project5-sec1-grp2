# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders. 

**Paper**: We provide a professional paper written in latex format with figures and tables labeled. The paper presents a novel analysis on how to analyze security prices. We provide background, mathematical models, and results and performance. For technical details, we provide proofs in appendix for further investigation.

Due to size limit, we uploaded zip folder for paper (a folder with tex files and PDF output) and presentation (a folder with tex files and PDF output).

**Presentation**: We provide and we will mainly use presentation, also written in latex, for presentation purpose. The presentation is condensed version of the paper. We are limited to 7 minutes during presentation and we will attempt our best effort to present the essence of the project within required period. The presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-project5-sec1proj5-grp2/blob/master/doc/Rubust%20Portfolio%20by%20Influence%20Measure%20-%20Presentation%20%5BYiqiao%20Yin%202018%5D.pdf). 

**App** In additional to main.R script, we also provide a subfolder, named "app". This folder contains an R script that designs a Shiny App. The app accepts any stock ticker in U.S. capital markets and the app will generate the designated results from the analysis we propose. The app also has some other features that link audience to SEC website for fundamental previews. This app should work as a supplement in additional to presentation. 

**R Notebook** In additional to files above, we also provide a R notebook, [image](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-project5-sec1proj5-grp2/blob/master/doc/main-notebook.Rmd). This R notebook calls **RData** saved in the **doc** folder. Then the script produces the graphs such as the following. The R Notebook is meant to work as one of the many supplements in support of the presentation materials just like R Shiny App above.
